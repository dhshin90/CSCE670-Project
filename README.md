austin_checkin.txt, austin_venue.txt, houston_checkin.txt, houston_venue.txt


## Directions:

1. Install a library, sklearn.
 
2. Put the data files into the same directory as project notebook-checkpoint.ipynb

3. Run the notebook from top to bottom. 

4. At a function, create_affinity_matrix, run one time phase at a time by commenting out the other four phases. 

5. At a function, spectralClustering, you will create a file from create_affinity_matrix, make sure to create a unique json file name to not replace previous files.

6. Now, you can see the inputs for a file, project.html, which is used to show the maps in the notebook, or you can check out http://people.tamu.edu/~donghwa_shin/
